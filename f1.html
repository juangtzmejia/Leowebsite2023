<h1>How can Red Bull improve in the battle with Mercedes and Ferrari?</h1><br><br>
<h3>Although Red Bull dominated the competition with the RB18 in 2022, there is still room for more performance in a few areas.</h3><br><br>

<p>Red Bull broke a lot of records in 2022 with their dominant RB18, breaking records previously held by Michael Schumacher in his Ferrari era.<BR><BR>

But as with all top sports teams, they strive for perfection. So what would have made that a perfect season for Red Bull in 2022? And what needs to be improved to ensure they keep on top of their main threats Mercedes and Ferrari?<BR><BR>

Close to the weight limit
Red Bull is among several teams that produced a car at the start of 2022 that was overweight. This was a byproduct of the new regulations, with weight reduction now a lot harder and most costly than it used to be.<BR><BR>

The team managed to get close to the 798kg limit during the course of the season, but Technical Director Pierre Wache told RacingNews365.com that they are still around 12kg over that limit.<BR><BR>

In 2023 the cars must be two kilograms lighter, which makes it an even tricker task for Red Bull. But should they manage to get under the weight limit, it will be a significant tool against the opposition.</p>
